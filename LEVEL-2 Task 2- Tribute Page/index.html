                <p>Bose's famous rallying cry, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," resonated deeply with a populace yearning for emancipation. His charismatic leadership, combined with his daring escape from British captivity and his establishment of the Free India Center in Berlin, showcased his strategic acumen and unwavering spirit.</p>
                
                <p>Despite the challenges posed by World War II and the complexities of international diplomacy, Bose's legacy continues to inspire generations.

            <h2>The INA and Azad Hind Fauj</h2>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's leadership of the INA marked a turning point in India's fight for independence. The Indian National Army (INA) and the Azad Hind Fauj were instrumental in Subhas Chandra Bose's efforts to liberate India from British rule during World War II. Formed in 1942, the INA aimed to unite Indian prisoners of war and civilians to challenge colonialism. Its activities, supported by Axis powers, ignited nationalist fervor and contributed to the Burma Campaign. The Azad Hind Fauj, synonymous with the INA, symbolized India's resolve for independence and drew global attention. Although its impact was limited by the war's end and Bose's death, their legacy persists as a testament to India's unwavering pursuit of freedom.</p>
